# Set Up an Advanced Trade

Advanced trades allow you to place a buy or sell order that will automatically execute when a currency reaches a chosen price threshold.

<img src="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/zondicons/20/exclamation-outline-512.png" width="24px"> Note: Advanced trades must include Bitcoin as one of the currencies. To trade between two non-Bitcoin currencies, trade from the first currency to Bitcoin then trade from Bitcoin to the second currency.

1. Click **Advanced Trade** in the top menu bar.

2. Click **Select Pair** to choose the currencies you want to trade.

    The Price Chart, Depth Chart, Order Book, and History will update to display your selected currencies. Use these to analyze recent market changes and inform your trading.

3. Click **Buy BTC** or **Sell BTC** to trade to or from Bitcoin, respectively.

4. Enter a **Limit Price** to determine the price point at which your trade will automatically execute.

    The **Actual Limit Price** displayed below your **Limit Price** may vary slightly from the amount you enter. This is because markets are priced in bits. Your limit will be automatically rounded to the nearest bit.

5. Enter the amount you want to invest upon reaching the **Limit Price**, or select a percentage of your current balance you want to invest.

    Your **Total Receiving** will automatically update to show an estimate of the amount you will receive when the trade executes. This estimate does not include fees, which are displayed above the Total Receiving.

6. Click **Place Buy Order**.

    A **Buy Order Confirmation** will pop up. Here you can review your trade before finalizing.

7. Click **Buy**.
