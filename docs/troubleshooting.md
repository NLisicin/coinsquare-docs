## Problems with Trading

If you are having problems with Quick or Advanced Trade, it may be caused by one or more of the following issues. Here you will find information on how to solve each of these problems.

### Insufficient Funds

You may not have enough funds in your account to make your trade. There are multiple ways to fund your account on Coinsquare.

Further instructions on each of the available methods can be found [here.](https://help.coinsquare.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000433631-Deposits-Withdrawals)
### Open Orders

Having even one Open Order for an Advanced Trade may stop you from to completing a Quick Trade. The funds allocated for your Advanced Trade are on hold until your Order is filled, so you will either have to cancel your Open Order or reduce your Quick Trade amount. 

You can learn how to cancel an Open Order [here.](https://help.coinsquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032261291-How-To-Cancel-an-Open-Order)
