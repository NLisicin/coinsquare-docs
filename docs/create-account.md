# Create and Verify Your Account

These instructions will guide you through the process of creating and verifying an account so you can begin using Coinsquare.

Verifying your account is necessary to confirm your identity and prevent illegal trading.

## Required Materials

Photos or scans of the front and back of two documents to verify your identity.
Files must be less than 3.5 MB and can be in JPG, JPEG, PNG, PDF, or GIF format. You will require the following:
* One piece of government-issued photo ID. Either a driver’s license, national ID card, or passport.
* One proof of address less than three months old. Either a water bill, electricity bill, internet bill, cable bill, or bank account statement.

1. To begin, click one of the blue **Get Started** buttons on the homepage.

2. Set up your account.

    a) Choose your username. This will be used to log in to the site. Your username must be between 5 and 15 characters long.
If your username is already taken, try again with another.

    b) Enter your email address.
    
    c) Choose a secure password. It can be between 9 and 64 characters long. 
    Don’t use a password which you’ve used for another website or account. Try to make the most secure password which you can also remember.
    
    d) Re-enter the password to confirm.

    e) OPTIONAL: If you have a referral code from a friend, enter it here.
    
    f) Select your country of residence from the drop-down menu.

    g) Read the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Click the box to check off your consent.

    h) Click the reCAPTCHA box that says **I’m not a robot**. This is to confirm your humanity.

    i) Once everything is done, the **Register** button at the bottom will change from grey to blue. Click on it to complete your sign up.

3. Verify your account.

At this point, you have successfully set up your account and it will be pending verification.

Coinsquare will take up to one business day to verify your credentials, after which a blue **VERIFIED** panel will appear next to your username in the top menu bar. Once verified, you can begin trading cryptocurrency.
